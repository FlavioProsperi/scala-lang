title: Scastie - An interactive playground for Scala.
---

The Scala Center team is happy to announce the end of the Beta for [Scastie](https://scastie.scala-lang.org).

## What can I do with Scastie?

Scastie can run any Scala program with any library in your browser. You don't need to download or install anything.

Using sbt behind the scenes makes it possible for us to support a large range of platforms (Scalac, Dotty, Scala.js, Scala Native, and Typelevel Scala). In our beta, we’ve included support for any version of Scalac as well as all published versions of Dotty and Scala.js. Support for Scala Native is forthcoming. Basing Scastie on sbt allows us to support newer Scala versions and resolve library dependencies on maven.

## How does Scastie work?

When a user evaluates their code, the browser sends all its input to our server. Based on the configuration, it will forward the evaluation to an sbt instance. The output will be streamed back to the user. A specific protocol will allow the client to interpret different events such as compiler errors, runtime exceptions, instrumentation, console output, etc.

## New features

### New UI

We collaborated with <a href="https://www.47deg.com/" target="_blank">47Deg</a> to provide a fresh UI.

### Sharing

The main purpose of Scastie is communicating with code examples. We have improved our sharing model. An anonymous user can save and fork snippets. If you want to keep track of your snippet, you can also login with GitHub. When logged in, you can create a new revision or edit existing ones.

### Scala.js

We added support for Scala.js. Once compiled, your snippet is run in your browser.

Html DOM elements refered in your code such as images appears in the editor for convenience. This feature is illustrated in this example: [such doge!](https://scastie.scala-lang.org/MasseGuillaume/KuKtYXx1SpW7gu5HUTmPSA/1).

Since the execution environment is your browser, you can set breakpoints in your javascript inspector. Source mapping is enabled and allowing you to step into your Scala code. This video illustrates how you can debug Scala.js.

## What's next

### Google Summer of Code

Dmitrii Petukhov was accepted as a Google Summer of Code student to work on
[Auto-completion and type information](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4568241046290432/#5494264097144832). Rory Graves, an ENSIME contributor, is the mentor for this project. ENSIME is an IDE server. It can power text editors such as vim an eclipse with IDE functionnalities such as autocompletion.

### Scala Center's Plan

The Scala Center will continue the development of Scastie. We want to improve the integration with Scala projects. We will add an embedded mode were you can include Scastie in your documentation. We also want to use existing data sources such as StackOverflow or GitHub to have more code examples.
